* Installation
** From binaries
   See the [[https://github.com/gleefre/TEMPLATE/releases/latest][latest release]].
** From source
*** Requirements
    - Libraries (most of them are available from quicklisp)
      - Depends on [[https://github.com/vydd/sketch][sketch]], [[https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch-utils][sketch-utils]],
      - You will need to use ~gleefre/dev~ branch of my sketch's [[https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch][fork]].
      - You will need to install [[https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch-utils][sketch-utils]] from source, while other libraries can be installed from [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][quicklisp]].
    - Foreign dependencies
      - SDL2, SDL2 Image, SDL2 TTF
        =sketch= relies on =SDL2= library which is a C library.
        See [[https://github.com/vydd/sketch#foreign-dependencies][sketch's README]] for more details.
**** Fetch non-quicklisp libraries
     You can fetch all non-quicklisp libraries with git clone:
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     cd $HOME/quicklisp/local-projects/
     git clone https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch -b gleefre/dev
     git clone https://github.com/Gleefre/sketch-utils
     #+END_SRC
*** Building
    You can build the game with make:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    # Builds TEMPLATE
    make build
    # Bundles executable and all needed resources to TEMPLATE/ folder
    make bundle
    # For linux
    # Adds run.sh script to the bundle and creates a zip archive
    make lin-bundle
    # For windows
    # Adds run.bat script to the bundle
    make win-bundle
    #+END_SRC
    You can also specify which lisp implementation to use (sbcl is used by default) with ~LISP~ variable:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    LISP=ccl make build
    #+END_SRC
**** Supported implementations
     sbcl, ccl.
*** Running from source
    To run this game you need to load the ~:TEMPLATE~ system:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (ql:quickload :TEMPLATE)
    #+END_SRC
    Then you need to call the main function:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (TEMPLATE:start)
    #+END_SRC
    To run the game from a script you might want to use the ~start-toplevel~ funtion:
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (TEMPLATE:start-toplevel)
    #+END_SRC
    ~start-toplevel~ is blocking and will close the lisp process when you close the game.
**** Supported implementations
     sbcl, ccl, ecl.
